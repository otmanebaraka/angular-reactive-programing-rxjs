# Angular Reactive Programming with Rxjs

This project explores and demonstrates powerful reactive programming techniques within Angular using the RxJS library.  The objective is to build efficient, user-friendly, and well-structured Angular components leveraging RxJS concepts.

## Key Features

* **Standalone Components:** Implementation of standalone components to promote better modularity and reusability.
* **CRUD Best Practices:**  Exemplary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation showcasing optimal ways to send HTTP requests, manage potential errors, and display loading indicators.
* **Resolvers, Guards, and Interceptors:**  Integration of Angular resolvers, route guards, and interceptors for data pre-fetching, route protection, and request/response modification.
* **Stream Caching:** Optimizations using caching techniques to store RxJS streams, thereby avoiding redundant calculations or network requests.
* **Infinite Scroll & Lazy Loading:** Implementation of infinite scroll functionality with lazy loading to improve the loading performance of large datasets.
* **Autocomplete with Search & Lazy Loading:**  Development of an autocomplete component that seamlessly handles search queries and lazy-loads results for an enhanced user experience.
